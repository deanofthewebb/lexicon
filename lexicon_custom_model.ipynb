    "# Lexicon - Custom Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will build a simple custom language model that is able to learn from any text data provided, and return a transcript with confidence values from input posed in speech utterances. I will use Google's cloud-based services to preprocess the input audio data and transcribe into an initial guess. Then I will train a model to improve on Google cloud speech API's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Google's cloud-based services, you first need to create an account on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com//).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each service you want to use, you have to enable use of that service."
