    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will build a simple custom ochestrator that processes data objects from the \"Lexicon\" class.\n",
    "    - These objects are custom datasets that are modeled after the Ted Talk speakers. \n",
    "    - Each Lexicon has a corpus and some helper methods aimed at training and prediction\n",
    "    - Lexicon class will also have a preprocessing and caching function.\n",
    "    - Each object will have two methods of prediction, n-gram language model and a recurrent neural network model\n",
    "    - Each object has a custom reporting function that reports the results of training\n",
    "    - Each object will be able to learn from any text data provided, and return a transcript with confidence values from input posed in speech utterances. \n",
    "        - I will use Google's cloud-based services to preprocess the input audio data and transcribe into an initial guess. Then I will train a model to improve on Google cloud speech API's response.\n"
